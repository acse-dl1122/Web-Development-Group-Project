            <pre>Once upon a time, a marvelous dreamer found the power to transform wishes into reality, and with just a sprinkle of pixie dust, 
a magical kingdom came alive for dreamers of all ages to enjoy. Soon the young at heart gathered from around the world, following 
their dreams to the place where anything is possible. The magic place where dreams come true.

            <pre><q>This is one of my favorite holiday events. I am bummed that I won't be going this year due to the pandemic, 
but I'm hoping we can all celebrate next year. The actors do a great job of staying in character and the vendors 
are equally delightful. The entire experience will convince you that you are in a magic world. There are fun 
shows too. See them all. I've been a few times and still feel like there is more to see. Decent variety of 
worldwide food and drink and above all - good cheer!</q></pre><br/>

            <pre><q>We had such a wonderful time! We arrived after 3pm to avail of the discounted tickets. There was a long 
line upon arrival which got longer shortly after arrival (perhaps due to the discounted rate).We left a little 
after 6 and it was just perfect. The kids were tired by then. Good experience for the kids.Performers, merchants 
and staff members were all friendly and nice. The restrooms were well kept.</q></pre> <br/>
